# 4-Cast

This website was made based on the curriculum of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) Javascript section. 4-Cast is made entirely with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and has really helped further my knowledge of the framework. 4-Cast utilizes [Open Weather's](https://openweathermap.org/api) amazing One Call API to deliver a large chunk of weather data per API call. To facilitate these API calls, 4-Cast features a self-rolled search system which helps match the desired city and country based on your input and retreive said cities coordinates.

## Learning Objectives

- Further my knowledge of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and make much more use of React Hooks in my code.
- Implement a full featured search bar that responds to many types of input and reacts to less desirable input accordingly.
- Improve my comfort with using 3rd party APIs and derive some influence towards helping my own API development in the future.
- Further my understanding of using asynchronous code in Javascript - centered around Async/Await.
- Write all my own CSS and don't utilize any frameworks to help with responsive layout or overall design.
- Make a website more responsive to various viewports
- Improve my overall design ideas and layout structuring
- Make my code more modular and partitioned overall
